# AOLBack (Server)
AOLBack is a project which tries to recreate AIM. It does not use the actual AIM client, it is just a replica using GTK and other libraries for Mac and Windows.

If you are looking for the client, look at the repo fgclue/aolback-client.

AOLBack is not affiliated with AOL, it is just a fan project.
